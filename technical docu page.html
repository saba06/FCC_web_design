                    Python is a high-level programming language like java,C & C++. <br>
                    There are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as “machine languages” or “assembly languages.” Loosely
                    speaking, computers can only run programs written in lowlevel languages. So programs written in a high-level language
                    have to be processed before
                    they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of
                    high-level languages. <br>
                    The advantages are enormous. First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language.
                    Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and
                    easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are
                    portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs
                    can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another. <br>
                    Unlike java,C & C++ python is Loosely typed; it dosen't type-check before running the program ( some what simillar to javascript).<br>
                    Python is a interpreted language it dosen't need a compile a program; create a object code to run on machine like java. <br> 
                    Python is considered an interpreted language because Python programs are executed by an
                    interpreter. There are two ways to use the interpreter: interactive mode and script mode.
                    In interactive mode, you type Python programs and the interpreter displays the result: <br>
                    <code class="code">
                        >>> 1 + 1 <br>
                        2
                    </code> 
                    <br>
                    The chevron, >>>, is the prompt the interpreter uses to indicate that it is ready. If you type
                    1 + 1, the interpreter replies 2.
                    Alternatively, you can store code in a file and use the interpreter to execute the contents of
                    the file, which is called a script. By convention, Python scripts have names that end with
                    .py. <br>
                    In later section you ll get to know how to execute python scripts.

                    NO Prerequisite are needed to learn python! However if you know java or any other high-level programming you can skim through this documentation whith great easy! <br>
                    Python has this great advantage that is lot easier both for beginners & other language programmers to learn.Code written in pyhton is a lot less verbose than written in java. <br>
                    To execute & practice code you need to have python installed on your machine. <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Click here </a> if you need help with it.

                <p>
                    Keep this in mind as you learn python:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python is interpreted language; it doesn't have compiler to warn syntax errors before you execute code! Syntax erros ll show up on runtime! (syntax is like grammer for programming language).</li>
                        <li>
                            Python is Loosely typed; it doesn't check for types until you run code in interpreter(also known as dynamic typing). So chances are you would have a lot of errors in beginning.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Python is Object-Oriented programming. Python supports object-oriented language and concepts
                            of classes, objects encapsulation, etc just like java & C++.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Python has a  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html"> large standard library</a> which provides a rich set of module and functions so you do not have to write your
                            own code for every single thing. There are many libraries present in python for such as regular expressions,
                            unit-testing, web browsers, etc.
                            Extensive open-source libraries exist in feilds of machine learning, web-development, data-science, gaming & many more!
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
                <header>Hello World</header>

                    print('Hello World')<br>
                </code> <br>
                Copy the above line of code into notepad or other code editor you have & save it with name 'Hello_World.py' . <br>
                Open in same folder cmd promt type 'py Hello_World.py'or 'python Hello_World.py' depending on your version of python. <br>
                This prints Hello World as output; this means you have sucessfully installed & run you first python script!
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
                <header>Variables</header>
                <p>
                    Variables are symbolic name to store values; also called as identifiers must conform with certain rules;variable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they have to begin with a letter. The underscore character, _, can appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as my_name or airspeed_of_unladen_swallow. <br>
                    <br>
                    If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error: (the following code is executed in python shell)<br>
                    <code class="code">
                        >>> 76trombones = 'big parade'<br>
                        SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                        >>> more@ = 1000000<br>
                        SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                        >>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'<br>
                        SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
                    </code> <br>
                    76trombones is illegal because it does not begin with a letter. more@ is illegal because it
                    contains an illegal character, @. But what’s wrong with class? It turns out that class is one of Python’s keywords. The interpreter uses keywords to recognize the structure of the program, and they cannot be used as variable names. <br>
                    Python 2 has 31 keywords: <br>
                    <table>

                    In Python 3, exec is no longer a keyword, but nonlocal is.
                    You might want to keep this list handy. If the interpreter complains about one of your
                    variable names and you don’t know why, see if it is on this list. <br>

                    </code>
                    Declaring variables very easy in python; use a valid identifier assign it any value using '=' operator. <br>
                    The above code prints the following output:
                    <code class="code">
                        1<br>

                        1.24<br>
                    </code> <br>
                    Notice multiple assignments on same x. python dosen't flag error as x has no type assign to it. This is the loose typing we were talking about <br>
                    <code class="code">
                        x,y= 1,"string"<br>

                    </code> <br>
                    The above code prints an error at runtime;

                    </code> <br>
                    until this line is reached your code runs fine!

                    </code>
                    What's the output of above code? Python has two scopes local & global. By default any variable defined has local scope until you use 'global' keyword when defining it. <br>
                    <code class="code">
                        x before func 11<br>
                        In func 1<br>
                        x after func 11<br>
                    </code> <br>
                    x=1 when defined has local scope; meaning it is only visible in local function you define it in. When defined in func(); x is a new variable assign a value 1. Hence x defined outside func() is not not affected. Every function returns to main flow of program after execution; this is when the new x  =  1 is disposed after return.

                    <code class="code">
                        def func():<br>
                            global x<br>
                            x=1<br>
                            print("In func ",x)<br>
                        x=11<br>
                        print("x before func",x)<br>
                        func()<br>
                        print("x after func",x)<br>
                    </code> <br>
                    Just adding global keyword before x in func() enables us to access global variable  x (= 11) & change it to 1.Therfore the output. <br>
                    <code class="code">
                        x before func 11<br>
                        In func 1<br>
                        x after func 1<br>
                    </code> <br>
                    Alternatively, you can define global x within func(). What's the output of following: <br>
                    <code class="code">
                        def func(): <br>
                            global x <br>
                            x=1<br>
                            print("In func ",x)<br>
                        func()<br>
                        print("x after func",x)<br>
                    </code> <br>
